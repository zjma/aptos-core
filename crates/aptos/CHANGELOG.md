# Aptos CLI Changelog

All notable changes to the Aptos CLI will be captured in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and the format set out by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
* If `aptos init` is run with a faucet URL specified (which happens by default when using the local, devnet, or testnet network options) and funding the account fails, the account creation is considered a failure and nothing is persisted. Previously it would report success despite the account not being created on chain.

## [1.0.8] - 2023/03/16
### Added
* Added an `aptos account derive-resource-account-address` command to add the ability to derive an address easily
* Added the ability for different input resource account seeds, to allow matching directly with onchain code
* Added beta support for coverage via `aptos move coverage` and `aptos move test --coverage`
* Added beta support for compiling with bytecode dependencies rather than source dependencies

### Fixed
* All resource account commands can now use `string_seed` which will match the onchain representation of `b"string"` rather than always derive a different address
* Tests that go over the bytecode size limit can now compile
* `vector<string>` inputs to now work for both `aptos move view` and `aptos move run`
* Governance proposal listing will now not crash on the latest on-chain format
* Move compiler will no longer use an environment variable to communicate between compiler and CLI for the bytecode version

## [1.0.7]
* For logs earlier than 1.0.7, please check out the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases?q="Aptos+CLI+Release")
